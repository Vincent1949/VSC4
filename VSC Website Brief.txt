Example Interaction:
Student: "What is the speed of light?"
Science Avatar:
* Voice Response: "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometres per second."
* Text Response: "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometres per second."
Student: "Can you explain why light has this speed?"
Science Avatar:
* Voice Response: "The speed of light is determined by the properties of space and the nature of light itself. It's a fundamental constant of nature."
* Text Response: "The speed of light is determined by the properties of space and the nature of light itself. It's a fundamental constant of nature."
